The Simple_Mods are not perfect by any means.
They are a project of passion and are created by one person who is a human being.
Issues can sneak their way into logic in many ways, simple and straight forward oversights or plain old "this worked before the last game patch".
We all know it, we all ~~hate~~ love! ark!

### So, what can you do when you encounter an issue?

The first thing I ask will always be: "Is your mod properly installed?"
Wish means if you have verified that your installation of the Simple_Mod is free of corrupted files.
This, sadly, happens quite often. But there are steps you can take to reduce the frequency of these errors happen.

 - Restart your game **BEFORE** joining the server again, if your server updated a mod and you have already have been ingame
 
 - Wait on the mod page until the mod is fully installed
 
 - Don't do anything that you think might interrupt the mod download
 
 - Make sure your internet connection is free of *hickups*, as in any form of temporary interruptions 
 
### How do I know if my installation is broken?

 - Only you are having this issue / nobody else is seeing what you are seeing / etc.
 
 - You can´t place a structure or it places another structure instead
 
 - My mod is not updating or downloading completly
 
 - You crash when doing X but players around you do not
 
These are some good indicators that your installation is broken. Of course there is the possibility that the mod itself is causing a crash or the structure won´t place.
But this is about excluding broken files as a cause. So don´t hate anyone when you are asked "have you tried reinstalling?".

### "What if not only I have this issue?"
It is possible for a mod to have broken files serverside. It doesn't happen as often but it is possible.
And there is a quick step to make sure the server redownloads the mod, actually all mod files.
You just run the ```cheat RedownloadModsOnServerRestart``` either from the ingame command console or from an external tool like R-Con.
After that, restart the server. You can use the ShooterGame.log file to verify that all mods have been redownloaded.

### "The issue is still happening, what now?"

If the issue persists and you made sure that broken files is not the cause, then it is time to ask the develeoper about it.
For that I ask you to visit my discord and more specific the [support](https://discord.gg/erfDHS89Hz) channel. There you can tell me about your problem and either I or others can provide pointers.
If it is a "user error", you will be shown in the right direction and missinterpretations can be clarified. If it is an actual issue that should not be there.
You will be asked to create post in the "report a bug" forum, descriping your situation. With enough info I can get to fixing as soon as possible. 
If I need more, I´ll ask you there.
